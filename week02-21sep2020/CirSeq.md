# Circular sequencing (CirSeq)

DRAFT

## What it does

Circularized genomic RNA fragments are used to generate tandem repeats.
They then serve as substrates for next-generation sequencing.
This provides sequence redundancy for a genomic fragment derived from a single individual within the virus population,
and thus overcomes the limitations of next-generation sequencing error [1, Abstract].
