# Circular sequencing (CirSeq)

DRAFT

## What it does [1, Main]

Circularized genomic RNA fragments are used to generate tandem repeats.
They then serve as substrates for next-generation sequencing.
This provides sequence redundancy for a genomic fragment derived from a single individual within the virus population.
Observed differences must originate from enzymatic or sequencing errors and can be filtered statistically.
This overcomes the limitations of next-generation sequencing error.
