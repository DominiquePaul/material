## ChIP-seq markdown

### what it does
ChIP-seq is a technique to assess where transcription factors and other proteins bind to DNA. It does so by using immunoprecipitation, which is a method that employs antibodies to precipitate DNA that is bound by protein and shear the rest of DNA. The precipitated DNA can then be sequenced.
